    <h1>HTML Tags are Not Case Sensitive.</h1>
    <p>In HTML, tags are not case-sensitive, meaning <h1>, <H1>, and <h1> are treated the same. This feature ensures flexibility and ease of use, as developers can write tags in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case without affecting functionality.</p>
        <h2>Key points on Tags</h2>
        <p>Ease of Coding: Developers do not need to strictly follow casing rules.
            Backward Compatibility: It aligns with older HTML versions where tags were not case-sensitive.
            HTML5 Standard: While HTML tags are case-insensitive, lowercase is recommended as a convention for cleaner, more consistent code.</p>
