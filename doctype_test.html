    <h1>Why Doctype is important.</h1>
    <p>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is crucial in HTML documents as it informs the web browser about the version of HTML being used. Its importance can be summarized as follows:

        Ensures Standards Mode: The <!DOCTYPE> declaration ensures the browser renders the page in "standards mode" rather than "quirks mode," avoiding potential inconsistencies in how web pages are displayed across different browsers.
        
        Compatibility: It promotes consistency in interpreting HTML and CSS, leading to predictable and uniform rendering of webpages.
        
        Validation: It helps developers validate their code against the HTML standard, making debugging easier and improving accessibility and SEO.
        
        Best Practices: Using <!DOCTYPE> is a web development best practice, signifying modern and professional coding standards.
        
        In modern web development, <!DOCTYPE html> is widely used for HTML5 and is simple yet essential for all web pages.
